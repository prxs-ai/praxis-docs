# Knowledge and Memory

Agents rely on two stores of information: a long‑term knowledge graph powered by **LightRAG** and short‑term memories stored in **Mem0**. These systems work together to provide context for planning and conversation.

## LightRAG Knowledge Graph

`LightRAG` maintains a persistent knowledge graph where documents and facts are indexed for retrieval‑augmented generation. The agent interacts with it through the `LightRagClient`.

```python
    def get_relevant_insights(self, goal: str) -> list[InsightModel]:
        """Retrieve relevant insights from LightRAG memory for the given goal."""
        response = self.lightrag_client.post(
            endpoint=self.lightrag_client.endpoints.query,
            json={
                "query": goal,
                "mode": "naive",
            },
        )
        texts = response.get("texts", [])
        return [InsightModel(domain_knowledge=text["text"]) for text in texts if "text" in text]
```
The client sends a query to the knowledge base and returns `InsightModel` objects for use during plan generation.

## Mem0 Interaction Memory

During every interaction the agent writes chat history and workflow results to Mem0 using the `MemoryClient`.

```python
    def store(self, key: str, interaction: list[Any]) -> None:
        try:
            logger.info(f"Storing interaction: {interaction} key: {key}")
            self.memory.add(interaction, run_id=key)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error storing interaction in Mem0: {e}")

    def read(self, key: str, limit: int = 10) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
        try:
            logger.info(f"Fetching all memories for key: {key}")
            return self.memory.get_all(run_id=key, limit=limit)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error retrieving interactions from Mem0: {e}")
            return []
```

These short‑term memories provide recent context for chat and planning.

Long‑term knowledge is fetched from LightRAG before planning while Mem0 supplies recent chat logs. Together they enable agents to reason over both persistent facts and the latest conversation history.
