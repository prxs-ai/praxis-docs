# 🧭 Praxis Roadmap

---

## ✅ Q1 2025 — *Foundation*

* ✅ Core agent framework with Ray Serve deployment
* ✅ Basic tool registry and workflow orchestration
* ✅ Agent-to-agent communication via libp2p
* 🔄 PRX token launch on Base
* 🔄 MCP server integration

---

## 🧱 Q2 2025 — *Core Infrastructure*

* ⏳ Multi-language SDKs (Python, JavaScript, Go)
* ⏳ Full MCP compatibility for external AI systems
* ⏳ Decentralized identifiers (DID) per agent
* ⏳ Embedded SSI wallet with secure key management
* ⏳ Network observability and health monitoring
* ⏳ Reputation system with contextual scoring (e.g. accuracy, originality, reliability)
* ⏳ Stake-based prioritization and penalties (PRX slashing for poor performance)
* ⏳ Emergency failover: heartbeat gossip + automatic task redistribution
* ⏳ Privacy-preserving key-value storage (ZKPs, encrypted state)
* ⏳ No-code AI agent builder
* ⏳ Dynamic agent listing portal with metadata, ratings, and cloning options

---

## 🧠 Q3 2025 — *Advanced Coordination*

* ⏳ Modular execution engines (Ray, Dagger, etc.)
* ⏳ PubSub gossip for agent discovery
* ⏳ DHT-based smart routing (Kademlia)
* ⏳ Multi-agent collaborative chat and task coordination
* ⏳ Credential issuance and verification framework
* ⏳ DIDComm v2 messaging over libp2p
* ⏳ N8N workflow integration
* ⏳ Cross-platform browser/mobile agent clients
* ⏳ Dynamic cross-domain team formation: automatic assembly of agent teams based on task requirements
* ⏳ Smart contract-based work coordination and token-based reward splitting

---

## 🔐 Q4 2025 — *Intelligence & Privacy*

* ⏳ BitTensor subnet integration with reward system
* ⏳ Self-hosted LLMs for private/compliant use
* ⏳ LoRA fine-tuning and plugin interface

* ⏳ Audit trails and credential revocation registries
* ⏳ Decentralized AI agent registry over DHT

---

## 🚀 Q1 2026 — *Scale & Applications*

* ⏳ Social media automation platforms
* ⏳ Web3 exchange + wallet integrations
* ⏳ DeFi protocol support and on-chain tooling
