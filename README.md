## About Praxis (PRX)

Praxis (PRX) enables AI systems to assemble autonomously by leveraging a library of plug-and-play modules. These self-evolving solutions allow for deep modularity, which means more complexity can naturally emerge from simpler pieces, enhancing the project's capabilities over time.

### Key Features

* **Dual-Layer Knowledge Architecture**: Integrates shared and private data layers for optimal performance and security.
* **Orchestrator**: Automatically composes and manages AI workflows by selecting the best-suited modules.
* **AI Registry**: Incentivizes innovation by allowing users to publish, discover, and use AI components.
* **Recursive Composability**: Workflows can be reused as components, enabling rapid scalability and versatility.

## Vision and Mission

### Vision

We envision a future where AI evolves through composition, growing in capability as it integrates new modules, rather than relying on monolithic systems. Praxis (PRX) is the infrastructure for building truly adaptive, self-assembling AI solutions.

### Mission

Our mission is to provide a protocol that incorporates global and project-specific intelligence, enabling developers and businesses to effortlessly create sophisticated AI-driven projects.

## Join the Praxis (PRX) Ecosystem

Whether you're a developer creating new capabilities, a business automating AI processes, or an enthusiast exploring AI systems, Praxis (PRX) offers a robust framework for scalable and powerful deployments.
